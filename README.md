# Milestone Project 1 - Starbomb
This website is for submission as my first milestone project. 
The goal of this site is to promote the band Starbomb by doing the folloing:
* Provide fans and potenial fans history of the band and its members.
* Promote the bands music and video via various channels
* Promote upcoming events and provide the ability to submit a form for booking.
* Promote mechandise sales for the band.

## UX

### Design
Website design was initially planned using the following wireframes which I created:

* [Desktop](assets/wireframes/desktop-wireframes.pdf)
* [Tablet](assets/wireframes/tablet-wireframes.pdf)
* [Mobile](assets/wireframes/mobile-wireframes.pdf)


## Features

### Index
The index page features a gallery of band photos, and a navigation bar which adapt display based on the screensize of the user primarily throught the use of Bootstrap.
The footer contains social media links which will open in a new tab.

### About
The about page features the same responsive navigation and footer of the index pade promoting familiarity of use.
This pages layout is achieved utilising rows and colums.

### Music
The about page features the same responsive navigation and footer of the index pade promoting familiarity of use.
This pages layout is achieved utilising rows and columns and embedded videos.
This page also contains additional links to music media sites which will open in a new tab.

### Events
The about page features the same responsive navigation and footer of the index pade promoting familiarity of use.
This pages layout is achieved utilising rows and columns.
This page also contains a form for submitting a contact request. Unfortunatly while this form functions on the surface, the information submitted is not passed anywhere valuable as of this release.

### Merch
The about page features the same responsive navigation and footer of the index pade promoting familiarity of use.
This pages layout is achieved utilising rows and columns. Although this page currently has the capability to accept the required information for ordering of merchandise this is a function not available in this release.
As stated below, this is a feature I hope to be able implement completely in the future.

## Features Left to Implement

Currently a non-working merch page is featured on this site, however I hope in the future with further study of javascript I will be able to make this a functioning page.


## Tecnologies Used
* All wireframes were created using the balsamiq wireframes software.
* Bootstrap 4 was utilised along with user created css stylesheets in the design and function of these pages.
* Javascript elements taken from the Bootstrap website.
